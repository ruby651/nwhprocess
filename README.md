# Dock-to-Stock Process Analysis and Redesign at NM Hospital

## Problem
NM Hospital (NMH), a leading academic medical center, faces significant inefficiencies in its supply chain operations, particularly in the dock-to-stock process, which currently averages three days. This delay in package delivery results in supply shortages on hospital floors, leading to overstocking and increased costs. Additionally, the absence of a systematic tracking system causes inaccurate inventory records, with packages often stored outside designated locations, leading to missing items and uncertainty in stock levels. These inefficiencies not only compromise timely access to essential medical supplies but also create safety hazards for receiving area staff, highlighting the urgent need for process optimisation.
With its vision of delivering exceptional healthcare experiences, NMH recognises the critical role of supply chain efficiency in meeting patient care demands. To support this, the hospital targets the timely, accurate, and cost-effective procurement and distribution of medical supplies, leveraging just-in-time inventory management to minimise delays and optimise resource utilisation.

## Analysis
### **Tools and Methodologies**
For process analysis and improvement, the following tools and methodologies were utilised:
- **BPMN on Apromore:** Employed Business Process Model and Notation (**BPMN**) to create accurate as-is process models, visualising current workflows.
- **Lean Six Sigma:** Applied **Waste and Value-added Analysis** to evaluate and streamline activities, identifying areas for improvement.
- **Fishbone Diagram:** Used to conduct **root cause analysis**, uncovering underlying issues affecting process performance.
- **Pick Chart:** Implemented a **Pick Chart** to prioritise process changes based on impact and feasibility, ensuring focus on high-value improvements.
- **BPR & HPR:** Leveraged **Business Process Reengineering** (BPR) and **Heuristic Process Redesign** (HPR) to define and implement to-be process improvements for greater efficiency and effectiveness.

## Key Findings
1. Inefficient Batch-Oriented Approach and Ineffective Use of Human Resources Causing Delays
2. Lack of Package Tracking and Delivery Visibility

## Solution
1. Activity Elimination & Composition, & Resource Optimisation
2. ERP System Implementation & Process Automation
3. Decentralised Decision-Making & Process Control

## Expected Impact
Implementing these solutions could result in the following key improvements:
- **66% reduction in cycle time**, reducing delivery to the par location to roughly 1 days.
- **50% drop in customer complaints** through quicker deliveries.
- **30% decrease in reordering**, leading to cost savings by preventing overstocking.
- **25% reduction in excess inventory**, improving stock accuracy and reducing return rates to 5%.
- **30% reduction in labor costs** through streamlined processes.
